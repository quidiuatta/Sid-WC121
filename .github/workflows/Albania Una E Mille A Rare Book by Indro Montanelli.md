## What is Albania Una E Mille about?
 
*Albania Una E Mille* is one of Montanelli's first books. It was published in 1939 by G. B. Paravia, a Turin-based publisher. The book consists of 154 pages divided into 12 chapters. Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of Albania's history, culture, society, economy, and politics. Some of the topics covered are:
 
- The origins and identity of the Albanian people
- The legacy of Skanderbeg, the national hero who fought against the Ottoman Empire
- The role of religion and ethnicity in shaping Albania's diversity
- The influence of Italy and other foreign powers on Albania's development
- The challenges and opportunities of modernization and progress
- The aspirations and struggles of the Albanian people for independence and democracy

The book is not a conventional history or sociology book. It is rather a personal and subjective account of Montanelli's observations and experiences in Albania.
